 Documentation and code for Andrew Unsworth's CMAS utility 
 CMAS calculates the accuracy stats of a binomial confusion matrix.
 There are currently two verisons of CMAS: one wirtten in Python adn the other in Java. The Jave version lets users enter data using a Swing GUI and view results in the GUI. The Python version takes input from the Python interpreter.
