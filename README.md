# CMAS Utility - Confusion Matrix Accuracy Statistics Utility
 Documentation and code for Andrew Unsworth's CMAS Utility 
 CMAS calculates the accuracy stats of a binomial confusion matrix.
 There are currently two verisons of CMAS: one written in Python and the other in Java. The Java version lets users enter data using a Swing GUI and view results in the GUI. The Python version takes input from the Python interpreter.
